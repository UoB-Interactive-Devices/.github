# Interactive Devices

Welcome to the Interactive Devices (COMS30054) Github. 

In this unit, you will: (1) develop an innovative device concept for consumers by identifying and addressing user needs; (2) learn to utilize common hardware tools (such as Arduino, electronic components, 3D printers, laser cutters, etc.) to build a prototype of an interactive device; (3) conduct user evaluations to assess your prototype's performance; and (4) document your journey in the form of a scientific paper, with the potential for submission to a real conference. Note that this unit is designed for students with little to no prior knowledge of hardware, but it is also suitable for those who are confident in this area as each project will be different. A background in HCI evaluation methods and iterative processes can help. However, it's common for groups to have members with varying skill levels, which can enhance the learning experience and contribute to a successful project. 


## Schedule and material

There are two slots of 3h in your calendar, one tuesday from 2 to 5 in MVB 
Week 13: slot 1 = introduction lecture.  slot 2= hands-on workshops
Week 14 to 23: slot 1 = group work with TA support / slot 2 = hands-on workshops 
Week 24: slot 1 = group work with TA support / slot 2 = demo 


## Assessement
This is a group project (4-5 people not more). Your assessment is based on two components: (1) a final paper and short video, due on the last day of the term, which accounts for 80% of your grade, and (2) a live demonstration during the last week of the term, accounting for 20%. All members of the team are expected to attend the demo. To pass the unit, your project must include an evaluated prototype using at least one Arduino (or equivalent board), a functioning demo for demo day, a written paper (max 8,000 words), and a video showcasing your working prototype. We will assess based on originality (how innovative the concept is), clarity of both writing and presentation, usability and interaction design (rather than hardware complexity), and the quality of the evaluation. For 4th-year students, we encourage you to form groups exclusively with other 4th-year students. As part of the group work, there is an additional assessment requirement: creating an 'Instructable' page (www.instructables.com). This will document the process of building your prototype in a clear, accessible way, allowing others to replicate and learn from your project. 

Each project will have a dedicated GitHub page for uploading materials, along with an Overleaf document linked to the page for paper drafting. We provide weekly feedback and guidance on your draft to help with your paper writing. While you can choose to write the paper entirely at the end of the term, this approach has not worked well for students over the past 14 years. Students who write their drafts incrementally each week and actively use feedback from TAs and staff consistently achieve higher grades.
